# TapMe

TapMe is a simple counter that contains a jump scare that is displayed randomly.
This is my first Swift 2 application inspired on "100 Days of Swift" [http://samvlu.com/index.html]

It helped me to learn: 
  - Build a simple interface with Labels and Buttons
  - Use 2 UIViewControllers and programatelly control a Segue
  - Load Images from a URL 
  - Play sounds using AVFoundation
